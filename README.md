# JavaScript Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose comparison (==) and null values.  The `foo` function correctly handles null inputs, returning null.  However, loose comparison can introduce subtle errors that may be difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

The core issue lies in the way JavaScript's loose comparison operator (==) handles null and 0.  While strict equality (===) distinguishes between null and 0, loose comparison treats them as equivalent in some cases. This can lead to unintended results and unexpected behavior, making it important to use strict equality when checking for null or other specific values.
